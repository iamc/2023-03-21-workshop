          <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>our workshop starts in less than two weeks and we are so excited to have you on board: https://coderefinery.github.io/2023-03-21-workshop/</p>
<p>The workshop will stream at: https://twitch.tv/coderefinery. You don't need a Twitch account. You only need a browser.
For the exercise sessions you can either follow on your own on as part of a group (more info below).</p>
<p>Below we summarize what you can expect and what you need to prepare. If your schedule changed and you cannot attend this time, please consider subscribing to our newsletter to get the information about upcoming events: https://coderefinery.org/#newsletter</p>
<p><strong>Q&amp;A during the workshop</strong></p>
<p>We will use a HedgeDoc collaborative document for questions and answers and &quot;real-time&quot; communication during the workshop. Everyone can read and write in that document. Please use caution and do not remove text that is not yours.
Save the link: (you can find it in the email confirming your registration)</p>
<p>Here are notes from our last workshop so that you can see where this is going: https://coderefinery.github.io/2022-09-20-workshop/questions/</p>
<p><strong>Preparing for the workshop</strong></p>
<p>Please go through our software installation instructions: https://coderefinery.github.io/installation/</p>
<p>This takes some time but with a workshop of this size (we expect over 300 participants), we cannot start installing and debugging during the workshop. We will also soon add a verification script that can give you feedback whether all requirements are met.</p>
<p>We hope that you will drop by in one of our install help sessions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Schedule: https://coderefinery.github.io/2023-03-21-workshop/#schedule</li>
<li>Zoom link: (you can find it in the email confirming your registration)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For those who wanted to be assigned to a team as learner or team lead</strong></p>
<p>There's still time to gather friends and colleagues to follow the workshop with you. If you have/get a team, we suggest you organize a video/in-person meeting for each day you want to participate the workshop.</p>
<p>Unfortunately we realized that we do not have the resources to form teams from individuals who do not know each other yet and we need to rely that teams self-organize. But don't worry, also participating as individual means you get the full workshop experience.</p>
<p><strong>For those who were interested in following in-person</strong></p>
<p>We will reach out to you in a separate email and we will try to help you to connect with others in the same location.</p>
<p><strong>Local organisers</strong></p>
<p>Please let us know if there is anything we can help with. Please check that you are listed here: https://coderefinery.github.io/2023-03-21-workshop/#partners and reach out to support@coderefinery.org if you want to be mentioned.</p>
<p><strong>Helpers, team leads, and observers</strong></p>
<p>Please attend one of our two onboarding sessions (if this is not your first workshop):</p>
<ul>
<li>Schedule: https://coderefinery.github.io/2023-03-21-workshop/#schedule</li>
<li>Zoom link: (you can find it in the email confirming your registration)</li>
</ul>
<p>We wish you all a happy and educating workshop!

        Subject: [CodeRefinery workshop] exercise teams
      </p>
      <p>
        <small>
          <p>Dear all, </p>
<p>when registering you have indicated that you wanted to be assigned to a team by organizers.</p>
<p>We have worked very hard to make that happen but it was too difficult for us to manage this. We expect over 300
participants and the scheduling and coordination effort to form teams and to reliably communicate
this information and connection details across spam filters and also managing no-shows or no-answers
is too tricky and risky for us. We decided to focus and optimize for excellent workshop experience
instead of spending significant time arranging and rearranging teams.</p>
<p>However, it is not a problem to participate on your own. You will still get the full workshop experience.</p>
<p>And it is not too late to form a small team with colleagues of yours!</p>
<p>Thank you for your understanding! My main regret is that those who volunteered to be a team leader for
a &quot;random&quot; team might not get the team lead experience. Please still consider joining our on-boarding
for team leads if you are interested: </p>

      </h5>
      <p>
        Subject: [CodeRefinery workshop] local exercise groups
      </p>
      <p>
        <small>
          <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>when registering you have indicated that you were interested in following in-person.</p>
<p>There are a number of local events that we know of:</p>
<ul>
<li>right hand side of: https://coderefinery.github.io/2023-03-21-workshop/</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are part of those, the local organizer has hopefully reached out to you
and you will get information about how to join exercise sessions from them.
Otherwise please reach out to us at support@coderefinery.org.</p>
<p>There were also many groups in various places who might be interested in
following in-person but we don't know whether you are in contact and are
already arranging an exercise room:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chalmers: 2</li>
<li>DTU: 2</li>
<li>Karolinska: 2</li>
<li>Lund: 4</li>
<li>Stockholm University: 2</li>
<li>UiO: 2</li>
<li>UiT: 5</li>
<li>Uppsala: 4</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are in one of those places and would like to organize your group, can you please reach out to us at support@coderefinery.org?</p>
<p>If you are in one of those places and you don't hear from us or from a local
organizer, then we were not able to find a local organizer. In this case please
follow the workshop on your own and don't worry: you will still get the full
workshop experience, including exercises.</p>

        2023-02-23 Email to team leaders
      </h5>
      <p>
        Subject: CodeRefinery Workshop info for team leaders
      </p>
      <p>
        <small>
          <p>Dear participant,</p>
<p>You get this email because you have indicated interest in &quot;being a team leader&quot; or that you &quot;might form a team with your colleagues&quot;. We sincerely appreciate your interest and want to offer support.</p>
<p><strong>Team leader</strong></p>
<p>A team leader encourages the team to discuss and ask questions. They can help the team but we assume them to be learners themselves, not experts. A team leader can handle posting team's questions to the Q&amp;A document or encourage the team to write.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a team: have some way to contact your team to fix meeting time and place. We do not follow or interfere with your team's communication.</li>
<li>If you don't have a team: you can either gather a team or let us know that you are available. This is done later via the registration form. We will send information on this closer to the workshop.</li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend all Team leads participate one of the onboarding sessions. See the schedule in https://coderefinery.github.io/2023-03-21-workshop/#schedule</p>
<p><strong>Forming a team with your colleagues</strong></p>
<p>We want to encourage everyone to gather together to follow the stream and collaborate on exercises (we refer to this as &quot;team&quot;). You can make it as low effort as you want. Some steps we recommend:</p>
<ul>
<li>book a space for the team</li>
<li>make sure that the team knows when and where to meet</li>
<li>have someone from the team to participate one onboarding session (see schedule in https://coderefinery.github.io/2023-03-21-workshop/#schedule)</li>
</ul>
<p>More information</p>
<p>We will add additional fields in the registration form closer to the workshop. Please follow the email communication.</p>
