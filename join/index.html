  </p>
</div>
<p>Anyone may watch the livestream (<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitch.tv/coderefinery">https://twitch.tv/coderefinery</a>).
You are free to attend just those days you want!<br />
Read more about <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/how-to-attend-stream/">how to attend a livestream course</a>.
Some partners host own video- or in-person exercise rooms. </p>
<h3 id="attend-via-livestream-only">Attend via livestream only</h3>
<p>The promise of the Internet is that we can reach everyone, so why
don't we?  We teach on a Twitch livestream
(<a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://twitch.tv/coderefinery">twitch.tv/coderefinery</a>) so that
anyone may attend the workshop.  With livestream attendance, you get:</p>
<ul>
<li>access to all workshop content, text and video</li>
<li>lesson recordings released usually on the same day</li>
<li>a channel for questions (if you register)</li>
<li>to do exercises yourself, or in a self-organized group</li>
</ul>
<p>Attendees report a great experience with these livestream courses!  You will be
able to ask us questions if you register. <strong>Please register in any case so that you
can get emails and we can better report our impact.</strong></p>
<h3 id="attend-with-own-team">Attend with own team</h3>
<p><strong>We recommend that you form your own team and do exercises together in-person
or online.</strong> We will support this as much as we can!
But please do all register individually so that we have a way to reach you all.</p>
<p>You can arrange everything with your friends and colleagues:</p>
<ul>
<li>agree where to meet</li>
<li>agree how to follow the workshop</li>
<li>maybe have some communications channel for your team</li>
<li>we send all registrants all information about the workshop</li>
<li>we don't need to know the details, but let us know if you have a team (for reporting purposes)</li>
</ul>
<p>Team team lead(s) should mark their interest in being an TL when
registering so that they get the additional information about on-boarding for
team leads, instructors, organizers, and observers.</p>
<h3 id="attend-in-a-local-partner-s-event">Attend in a local partner's event</h3>
<p>Some of our partners arrange an on-site meetings where they follow the teaching
together and get in-person assistance.  Feel free to suggest your educational
institute to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://coderefinery.org/organization/partners/#joining-as-a-partner">become a
partner</a>
and/or arrange a local breakout room.</p>
<h3 id="faq-how-should-i-register">FAQ: how should I register?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>I am registering alone (not as part of a team) and want to work with others face-to-face, how should I register?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The registration form has an option: &quot;I might be interested in following
in-person&quot;. Use that to get more information about local events that we a
aware of. If there's no local event in your area you get the
livestream anyway.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>I am making my own team, how should I register?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The registration form has an option: &quot;I might form a team with my
colleagues&quot;. Make sure you team has at least one team lead and that
they have indicated that while registering.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Our team will work together in a physical room, is there any point to joining the CodeRefinery Zoom?</strong>
<ul>
<li>No need. If you all get stuck in the exercises you can ask questions via the Q&amp;A channel.
Note that some Zoom etc. can still be useful in the physical room for screen-sharing with each other.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Does everyone on the team need to register?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Yes please. Then everyone gets information and connection details. Also we
are asked to report how many participants we have.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>I want to be an team lead or an observer. How do I register?</strong>
<ul>
<li>The registration form has an option: &quot;I might be interested in being a
general helper, co-instructor or observer&quot;.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>I'm an organization or group, I want to sponsor my community's teams!</strong>
<ul>
<li>Great! In general what you can do is to gather people together to follow the workshop.

and <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/chat/">contact us</a>.</li>
<li>If you arrange a local event, advertise it and let us know so we can also advertise it to the registrants!</li>
<li>Please guide everyone to register in our registration form.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>I registered and changed my mind about a team. What do I do?</strong>
<ul>
<li>Please let us know in <a href="mailto:support@coderefinery.org">support@coderefinery.org</a></li>

</ul>
<h3 id="volunteer-as-team-lead">Volunteer as team lead</h3>
<p>CodeRefinery's mission is to enable everyone to use the computational
tools they need for their work.  We do this by teaching the most important
software development tools, which are often missed in other coursework.
This is a big task, but together with our volunteer team leaders,
we can do it.</p>
<p>Volunteer to be an <strong>team leader</strong> at CodeRefinery, and you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mentor and provide positive encouragement for your team; guide them
through the workshop.</li>
<li>Attend our quick team leader training (one hour, see schedule).</li>
<li>Have your own team (breakout room of ~5) during the course.</li>
<li>Help keep the team on track.  You are the first line, but you don't
need to know everything.</li>
<li>Call for other help when needed. We have the collaborative Q&amp;A document for everyone.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Am I good enough to be a team leader?</strong>  If you are asking this
question, probably you are. If you have some familiarity with
Git, you can provide some initial advice on obvious error messages, 
but the idea is that you are able to ask for advanced help when it's needed.</p>
<p><strong>You don't have to be located in the Nordics</strong>. We welcome volunteers from
institutions also outside the Nordics because volunteer team leaders help
us to reach more people.</p>
<p><strong>How do I register as an team leader?</strong> Our registration
form has an option to indicate your interest to participate as team leader.</p>
<p><strong>Teams?</strong>  If you have friends or colleagues you would like to
mentor, please have them to register as well. Select &quot;I might form a team with my colleagues&quot; 
or &quot;I am attending a local exercise room but registering here to get the emails&quot;. 
Working together makes it much more likely to have a lasting effect in your group.</p>
<p>See also the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/exercise-leaders/">helper
introduction</a> and how
to <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/contributing/">get more involved in CodeRefinery</a> - perhaps
you want to sponsor workshops or get more involved in organizing a workshop.</p>
<h3 id="price-and-attendance-priority-policy">Price and attendance priority policy</h3>
<p>The course is free of charge, funded by the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://neic.no/">Nordic e-Infrastructure
Collaboration</a>.</p>
<p>The livestream can scale up to an arbitrary number of viewers. 
The local partners usually use &quot;first come - first served&quot;-principle + a waitlist. 
Some might also accept only members of their own organisation.</p>
<h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h3>
<p>We hope that everyone can attend and learn from this workshop, but we
aren't perfect.  Our attempts are mentioned below, if you would like
to help or there is something else we can do, please get in touch.</p>
<ul>
<li>Breakout rooms with team leaders gives a community atmosphere
and private help.</li>
<li>Our material is provided in writing (lesson websites), by voice, and
by demo.</li>
<li>We record videos and post the notes so you can review at your own
pace later on.  Videos don't include audience voice or video.</li>
<li>A collaborative document allows everybody to ask questions anonymously and
asynchronously, without interrupting others.  On the other hand,
there are many questions, so don't let it distract you from
the main lecture.</li>
<li>Lesson websites and collaborative document use standard web technologies, so that
browser accessibility plugins can be used (for example making the
font more accessible, check browser extensions).</li>
<li>Twitch can be live-captioned using the Google Chrome browser.</li>
<li>You can follow along without providing any personal data
(registration, Twitch works with cookies blocked).</li>
<li>We have figures in some lessons which are somewhat important,
without good alt text.  We are working on this, contributions
welcome.</li>
